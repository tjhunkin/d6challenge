// the issue here is using a closure inside a loop as if it were copying the value of the loop's index variable
// the anonymous function keeps a reference to i. At the time console.log gets called, the for loop has already finished, and the value of i has been set to 3.

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {

	};

// the solution is to create a copy of k in an anonymous wrapper
